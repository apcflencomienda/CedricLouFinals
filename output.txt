2. Project Overview 
Project Title: Lumos: The AI Enviroment Companion 
The Elevator Pitch: 
Lumos is a portable, AI-driven workspace companion powered by the Arduino R4 WiFi. Unlike 
static sensor kits, Lumos adapts to its environment. Through a 'Chat with Room' interface, the 
user can tell the system its new location (e.), allowing Google Gemini AI to recalibrate its 
analysis of noise, light, and temperature to suit that specific context 
Problem Statement: 
Standard IoT devices use fixed thresholds (e.g., 'If Light < 300, turn on LED'). This fails when 
the device moves; 300 lumens is 'bright' for a bedroom but 'dim' for a library. We need 
Generative AI to understand these changing contexts. By chatting with the device to update 
its location, the system can dynamically shift its 'comfort' definitions without requiring code 
changes. 
3. Technical Stack 
 
A. Hardware (The Embedded Side) 
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi  
Inputs (Sensors):  
• 
Photoresistor (Light Level) 
• 
Thermistor (Temperature) 
• 
Push Button (Manual "AI Query" Trigger) 
Outputs (Actuators):  
• 
Built-in 12x8 LED Matrix (Unique R4 feature for scrolling text) 
• 
RGB LED (Visual Mood Indicator) 
• 
Active Buzzer (Audible Alerts for extreme conditions) 
Power Source: USB-C (via Laptop/PC)  
B. Software (The Web Side) 
● Frontend: Tailwind CSS / HTML / JavaScript 
● Backend: PHP 
● Database: MySQL 
● Hosting: Localhost (XAMPP/WAMP) 
C. Artificial Intelligence (The Brain) 
● AI Model: (e.g., Google Gemini API, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) 
● AI Task: (Check one) 
○ [ ] Generative: Converting text to hardware commands (Natural Language 
Processing). 
○ [ ] Classification: Deciding if data is "Good" or "Bad" (Sentiment Analysis). 
○ [ ] Summarization: Reading logs and explaining what happened. 
○ [ ] Expert System: Providing specific advice based on sensor data. 
● Sample Prompt: 
(Write the actual prompt you will send to the AI. Example: "Analyze this text: 
'$user_input'. Return a JSON object with 'color_hex' and 'motor_speed' based on the 
emotion.") 
 
4. System Logic (The Flow) 
Scenario A: Sensor Monitoring 
• 
Input: Sensor reads "Temp: 30°C, Light: 20% (Dim)". 
• 
Processing: PHP sends this data to Google Gemini API via a custom prompt. 
• 
AI Decision: The AI replies with: JSON { "color": "#FF0000", "message": "Too Hot! 
Break Time." }. 
• 
Actuation: Arduino reads the database via HTTP GET and turns on the LED Matrix to 
scroll "Too Hot!" and sets RGB LED to Red. 
Scenario B: Chat & Location Update 
• 
Input: User moves the device and types "I am now in the bedroom" into the Chat tab. 
• 
Processing: PHP stores "bedroom" as the active current_context in the database. 
• 
AI Decision: Gemini acknowledges the shift: "Understood. Switching to 'Relaxation 
Mode' thresholds. I will warn you if the lights are too cool/blue." 
• 
Actuation: The Arduino R4 flashes BLUE twice to confirm the mode switch.
